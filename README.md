This page will help you easily convert the time in a specific location to a different
location.

Timezone functionality added. Styling still needs to be updated a bit. The github
Preview does not display the right styling for some reason. I'm blaming them for now.
I've also had issues with the preview in Chrome.


Check out the preview here:
